            Tea was first found in....<br />CHINA<br />
            There is a legend out there that says that Emperor Shen Nong of China was the first to discover
            tea, however he discovered it accidentally. While the emperor was preparing a boiling hot bowl of water, tea
            leaves flew through the wind and found their way inside the water he was preparing.

            There is a tropical plant known as Camellia Sinensis. All of our tea comes from this plant. These tea plants
            grow in different altitudes ranging from sea level to 7000 feet. The latitudes are as far north as Turkey
            and as far north as Argentina. The higher the altitudes are, the better the tea.

            Tea was first used for medicinal purposes and secondly as a pleasurable drink to be
            enjoyed. It took roughly over 3000 years for tea to rise up as one of the top pleasurable
            drinks throughout the Chinese empire.
